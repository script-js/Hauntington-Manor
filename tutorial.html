    <h1>Someone has been murdered!</h1>
    <p>The owner of Hauntington Manor has been murdered by one of his party guests. The people at his party were shocked, and tried to leave the house, but the owner's spirit would not let them leave. It told them that in order to leave the house, they must find out who killed him by midnight. None of them knew what to do, and the murderer wouldn't come clean, so they hired you, the best detective in the area.</p>
    <p>Use the arrow keys or buttons to explore the house, finding clues along the way. Most people will tell you what they know, but be warned: some of them have formed an alliance with the murderer and will try to mislead you.</p>
